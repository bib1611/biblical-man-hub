# Task Management Prompts

## Task Breakdown
When given a complex task, break it down into smaller, actionable steps. Each step should be:
- Specific and measurable
- Independent where possible
- Achievable in a single session

## Priority Assessment
Evaluate tasks based on:
1. Urgency - Time-sensitive requirements
2. Impact - Value delivered when completed
3. Dependencies - What blocks other work
4. Effort - Resources required

## Progress Tracking
- Update status as work progresses
- Mark blockers immediately
- Document decisions and rationale
- Link related tasks together

## Completion Criteria
A task is complete when:
- All acceptance criteria are met
- Tests pass (if applicable)
- Documentation is updated
- Code review is approved (if applicable)
